      "The core Python libraries, along with external packages such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `pandas`, and others,\n",
      "provide both low-level and high-level methods for extracting data from files, processing this data, and\n",
      "saving results back to disk.\n",
      "\n",
      "In this lesson, we will read text-based data files in two ways. First, we will use Python's low level\n",
      "file reader and writer to examine the contents of a relatively unstructured text file, perform some analysis,\n",
      "and write our results back out to another text file. Second, we will use high-level helper functions\n",
      "from `matplotlib` to easily read, modify, and write back out a csv file (csv stands for comma-separated\n",
      "values, and is the kind of data that you might have in a spreadsheet).\n",
      "\n",
      "In general, you will want to use easy, high-level approaches whenever possible (they will save you time\n",
      "and probably errors) and switch over to the low-level methods when your data have an unusual structure\n",
      "that the high-level readers cannot deal with easily. There are other high-level file handlers in `numpy`,\n",
      "such as `loadtxt` and `savetxt`, and `pandas`, such as `from_csv` and `to_csv`, that are also useful,\n",
      "and we encourage you to look into them."

      "each line in turn to determine what to do with it (ie, save it, skip it, extract some information, etc.).\n",

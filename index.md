title: Data Science Lessons
---

This site contains lesson materials developed by Justin Kitzes for teaching 
data science skills to scientists. The lessons are designed to concisely 
introduce the core best practices that are needed to make computational 
research efficient, accurate, maintainable, and reproducible. The current v0.3 
of these materials covers the shell, scientific Python, version control, unit 
testing, and reproducible workflows.

If you are a beginning data scientist looking for a self-guided tutorial, I 
suggest that you work through the lessons in the order presented below. You'll 
need to install a few software packages as described in the [setup 
page]({{page.root}}/setup.html).

If you are a Software Carpentry instructor who would like to use these lessons 
in a bootcamp, refer to the [GitHub 
repo](http://github.com/jkitzes/datasci-lessons) associated with this site, 
which contains instructions for merging these lessons into the standard 
Software Carpentry bootcamp repository.

About
-----

These lessons were developed by me, [Justin Kitzes](http://justinkitzes.com/), 
mostly in the context of teaching two-day bootcamps sponsored by [Software 
Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/). In my day job, I am a quantitative 
ecologist based at the University of California, Berkeley, where I develop 
theory and models to predict the effects of land use and climate change on 
biodiveristy.
